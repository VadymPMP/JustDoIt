# JustDoIt is a project that allows you to keep your online diary and make entries in it.
It was decided to do the backend on the .Net Core platform. The frontend is implemented using React technology, a library for creating one-page projects. The frontend communicates with the backend via http requests.
In the future, it is planned to add authentication and registration, improve layout and design.
